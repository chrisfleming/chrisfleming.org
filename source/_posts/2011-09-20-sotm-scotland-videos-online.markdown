As well as [Bob](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Central%20America) doing an introduction to [OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.org) (above), all the video's from the conference, including [my talk](http://www.chrisfleming.org/osm/state-of-the-map-scotland-the-state-of-scotland/) all now up, at: [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map_Scotland_2011#Schedule](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map_Scotland_2011#Schedule)

Hopefully I'll get my slides from the other talk I did, on making my festival map (reused from [WhereCamp EU](http://wherecamp.eu/)) online in the next few days.

Finally a big thanks to "the other" Bob from [City Strolls](http://www.citystrolls.com/) for doing the had work of making and editing the video's.
