We just got back from our [annual](http://www.chrisfleming.org/gallery2/v/friends/04Feb_Edmundbyers_0/) [weekend](http://www.chrisfleming.org/gallery2/v/friends/Wales2007/) [away](http://www.chrisfleming.org/gallery2/v/friends/Lakes2009/) with friends.

As usual I took the GPS down with me do do some [OpenStreetMapping](http://www.openstreetmap.org/),  however the map is so good these days that apart from the[ odd postbox](http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/652878753) and having to reclassify a [track to a road](http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/39990472) there was not a huge amount to add. I was even able to use the garmin files to successfully navigate a small walk.

This left plenty of time to drink a few beers and take lots of [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisfleming/sets/72157623378448985/detail/) :)
