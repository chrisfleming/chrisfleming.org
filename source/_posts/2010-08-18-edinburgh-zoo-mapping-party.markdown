So this is a **very **long overdue writeup of the [Edinburgh Zoo](http://www.edinburghzoo.org.uk/) mapping party that took place on Saturday 3rd July. Thanks to the work that [Bob](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Central_America) had done not only were the zoo expecting us but also allowed us in for free in order to make the map.

We used the zoo's own map to create a cake and each took an area to map.

I had picked the top of the hill to the North East, which included the Big Cats:

Overall the area division worked well, we did have some overlap but largely deliberate and partly to explore the rest of the zoo :)

The biggest challenge turned out to be that working on such a small scale in a heavily wooded environment meant that GPS traces were very unreliable, so a lot of the actual mapping came down to using the traces as guidelines and some dead reckoning. Trying to make sure that everything is relatively well positionedÂ  and fitting all the features in was a good challenge. Perhaps another trip in the winter when the trees won't have any leaves with some walking papers will be in order?

It wasn't all work, I certainly paused to see some of the animals and happened to be passing animal antics during one of the demonstrations, unfortunately I didn't get the name of this bird as there were no signs to photograph:

However at the end of the day we ended up with a much better map of the zoo, hopefully with all the enclosures covered:

Finally the picture of the "brave" mappers who turned up to do the day's mapping.
