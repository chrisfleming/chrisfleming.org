The baby is now much bigger than when this scan was done... and some folks I work with requested a dashboard. So the answer all your questions is at [http://isthebabyreadyyet.chrisfleming.org/](http://isthebabyreadyyet.chrisfleming.org)

I'm not sure how much time I'll actually have to keep this up to date, but there will be some updates.

The source (a horrid mix of html, css and javascript) is [available on github.](https://github.com/chrisfleming/IS-The-baby-ready-yet-)
