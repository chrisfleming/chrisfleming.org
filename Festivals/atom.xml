    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So for anyone not following me on twitter, I’m currently attending <a href="http://culturehackscotland.com/">Culture Hack Scotland</a>; basically the big idea is to try and bring the tech and culture communities together. This is also based around a set of <a href="http://culturehackscotland.com/data">open data</a> which including fringe data, although for 2011 at least the fringe data will have some restrictions applied to it; however it’s a great step forward.</p>

<p>There are lots of idea’s going on, some of which are quite exciting. However my plan is to work on a “Festival” Rendering of openstreetmap for Edinburgh, I’m really just at the point where I can start to render maps and have a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Edinburgh_Festivals">proposed tagging scheme</a> for doing this within OSM.</p>

<p>Still lots of work to do but at the moment I have started to put Fringe Venues on the map:</p>
