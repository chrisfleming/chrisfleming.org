    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve just noticed that Google have finally got round to updating the Google Earth imagery for Edinburgh. It’s about time to as the
<a href="http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=55.946725~-3.193932&amp;style=a&amp;lvl=14&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000">Microsoft</a> 
and <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=s&amp;trf=0&amp;lon=-3.192129&amp;lat=55.945223&amp;mag=3">Yahoo</a> aerial imagery have covered Edinburgh for some time now.</p>

<p>It looks to me like the images of Edinburgh were captured  in August last year, the level of detail is very impressive. 
A few nice things to point out here are, sitting on the Meadows we can see the big top circus tent and fairground used over the festival.

<p>Also of interest is the aerial view of of the <a href="http://www.qmile.com/">Quartermile</a> development. We can see how much of the area has been 
demolished and how much the area still has to be developed.</p>

<p>The winding areas of the castle is also well worth a look. The bandstands put up for the <a href="http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/">Edinburgh  Tattoo</a>
is in evidence on the esplanade.</p>
