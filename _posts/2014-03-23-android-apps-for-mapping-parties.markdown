So with a [mapping party](http://attending.io/events/localtivate-mapping-day)
coming up next weekend.  I thought that it was about time that I start this
series of posts that I've been planning for a while, so hopefully here is part
1. Android Apps 

##Â Tracking #

One of the key apps, is something that can track where you are, providing a
record of where you've been and allowing you to upload it to the OpenStreetMap
website.

I use [OSM Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker)
it's a simple app, and does it well, as well as recording a GPS trail, it also 
allows you to take pictures, and display the track on a map.

Use is really simple, start a new track:

Once it is running, it displays the currently GPS Position, shortcuts for taking a picture, and noting various features:

It is also possible to view the track on a map, this is really useful for checking the current area mapped, and seeing where you've been:

Finally, it's possible to tag save and upload the track:

## Editing #

Editing is generally done as after mapping on a computer, but it can be really helpful to be able to make some changes from your phone, especially once you're more
experiences, I would recommend using [Vespucci](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android), 
Vespucci is getting better and better all the time, and does a really good job editing using the touch interface. 

When you click on the map, it allows you to choose what item you wish to edit, which is a good solution to the problem of never being able to select accuratly enough with
your finger. Geometries can then we tweaked as neccessary.

Although I tend to use it to make small changes sich as tags rather than big edits.
