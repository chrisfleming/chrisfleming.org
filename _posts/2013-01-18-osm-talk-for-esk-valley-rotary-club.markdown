![OpenStreetMap: An Introduction; Rotary Club of Esk Valley, 15 January 2012](/post-assets/2013-01-18-osm-talk-for-esk-valley-rotary-club/jan_2013_talk.001.jpg)

I had the plesure of doing a talk for the [Rotary Club of Esk Valley ](http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/homepage.php?ClubID=1868)this Tuesday, the talk was based on the [talk I gave at SoTM Scotland,](http://www.chrisfleming.org/osm/state-of-the-map-scotland-2013-the-state-of-scotland/)  with some of the more detailed information removed and some more introductory material added. So this posting is to cover some of the new stuff I covered or at least meant to cover.

I started with an introduction to [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) briefly touching on the [licencing terms](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/) and then lot of examples, such as [cyclestreets ](http://www.cyclestreets.net/)for cycle planning, [foursquare](http://blog.foursquare.com/2012/02/29/foursquare-is-joining-the-openstreetmap-movement-say-hi-to-pretty-new-maps/), [ski maps](http://openpistemap.org/?lat=56.8831&lon=-3.4034&zoom=14&layers=BTTTT), and not forgetting the [Gaelic Map](http://osmalba.org/).

I then moved on to talk about [HOT](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/)'s Humanitarian Work, borrowing lots of material from a [previous HOT presentation](http://www.averillpark.net/OSM/HOT/).

After some talk about quality and contributors, I showed how to create an account and some slides on starting to use potlatch. I moved on to talk about phone apps. The full list for [Android](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android) and [iOS](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Apple_iOS) on the OSM wiki is quite intimidating so I wanted to give some specific suggestions to help get people started.

Simplest of all and working on both platforms is [wheelmap.org](http://wheelmap.org/)Which provides a really simple interface to allow users to add accessibility information to existing places in OSM.

To add or edit POI's on iOS there really is a simple choice, [Pushpin](http://pushpinosm.org/) a really nice simple well though out interface.

On Android, I recommend  [Vespucci](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android), it's not as simple as pushpin but does allow a lot more to be edited on the go.

For more advanced mapping users may want to [collect tracks](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners_Guide_1.2). For Android I had lots of apps to choose from:

![OSM Tracker App](/post-assets/2013-01-18-osm-talk-for-esk-valley-rotary-club/jan_2013_talk.061.jpg)

and I would recommend[ OSMtracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker), it collects the GPS track and also allows some POI's to be noted on the go.

![OSM4iPhone Screenshot](/post-assets/2013-01-18-osm-talk-for-esk-valley-rotary-club/jan_2013_talk.062.jpg)

The choice was much more limited on iOS and in the end I couldn't quickly find a free app, so I find myself recommending [OSMTrack](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/osmtrack/id295625255?mt=8) which costs a mere 69p as is ideal as it can upload directly into OSM as well as supporting offline data.

and that was it, I had already talked far too long and so it was time to finsh up and go to questions.

We had some good questions, about using [OSM for teaching](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Education), one of the users had already installed wheelmap and was adding information.

Someone also asked if we had Kevock Road, so I took a deep breath and entered it into the search box.

and I was very happy to find the road was there and we had lots of details around it.

A big thanks to the Club for inviting me out and being such a good audience.
