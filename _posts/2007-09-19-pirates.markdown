So I just happened to upload this picture on to [my flickr pages](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisfleming/) in the early hours of the morning, 
not because of [talk like a pirate day](http://www.yarr.org.uk/), but as part of my general sorting out of my photos taken over the Summer. 
However because of the pirate theme, it has made it's way onto the "Interesting" page on flickr!

We had stopped at [Melrose Abbey](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisfleming/1404515378/) 
on the way back from [Katherine and Colin's wedding](http://www.chrisfleming.org/gallery2/v/friends/Katherine_and_Colins_Wedding/), 
and I took this picture while walking about on a fine sunny day.

**UPDATE: **Thanks to [http://www.syddware.com/cgi-bin/pirate.pl](http://www.syddware.com/cgi-bin/pirate.pl)

A sea dog says 't this way:

Ya  scurvy dog who ortin' t' be keel hauled!

**UPDATE2: **Thanks to comments on Flickr, the Latin above reads "memento  mori"  or "remember you are mortal", 
or something of that ilk? (someone  else recons  "Mei Entomo") anyone any ideas?
