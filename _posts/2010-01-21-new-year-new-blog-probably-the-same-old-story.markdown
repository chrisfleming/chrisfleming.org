So here I am again. I've switch the blog from [serendipity](http://www.s9y.org/) to [wordpress](http://wordpress.org/).
Despite the possible security issues with  wordpress, I've a number of wordpress blogs and I have a script which should 
help me keep them all up to date using svn.

In addition, I'm in the process of moving my hosting from [gradwell](http://www.gradwell.com/) to a Virtual Machine hosted by 
[bytemark](http://www.bytemark.co.uk/) partly because it will be cheaper for me and also because I was finding it hard
getting support questions answered by  gradwell. This also means that at low volumes the response time from a dedicated
server is much faster than from shared hosting. With the rollout of google's new Caffeine infrastructure it's likely that 
[speed will become a factor in the search results](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/01/state-of-index-2009.html).

So I've also built a new template for the site. It's basically a cut down hacked around version of the standard wordpress
[kubrik template](http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/kubrick/). From the previous site I've cut down on the use of colour
and I've dropped headers entirely and kept a single sidebar. There are lots of tweaks that still need to be applied.

So, I'm hoping to provide regular updates on my usual activities... Progress on the bread making front, 
[photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisfleming), 
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), 
[Bedlamites](http://www.bedlamites.co.uk/) and whatever else comes up :)
In reality I probably won't end up doing anything for another 3 months.
