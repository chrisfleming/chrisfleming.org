Sunset over the Forth and Union Canal](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisfleming/415765671/)
This was taken from the Lemmington Lift Bridge, looking West.
I caught the sun setting over the canal, I love the contrast of angular lines of the soon to be demolished brewery on the right and the raggard roof lines of the flats on the left.
