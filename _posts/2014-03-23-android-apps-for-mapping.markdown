So with a [mapping party](http://attending.io/events/localtivate-mapping-day)
coming at the weekend.  I thought that it was about time that I start this
series of posts that I've been planning for a while, so hopefully here is part
1 Android applications for collecting data.

##Â Tracking, OSM Tracker #

One of the key apps, is something that can track where you are, providing a
record of where you've been and allowing you to upload it to the OpenStreetMap
website. OSM's heritage is built around collecting data using a GPS, and it still 
remains a powerfull way of mapping an area without requiring other sources. And 
we actually are all carrying a GPS device around with us in our pocket it is
very easy to do.

I use [OSM Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker)
it's a simple app, and does it well, as well as recording a GPS trail, it also 
allows you to take pictures, and display the track on a map.

Use is really simple, start a new track:

Once it is running, it displays the currently GPS Position, shortcuts for taking a picture, and noting various features:

It is also possible to view the track on a map, this is really useful for checking the current area mapped, and seeing where you've been:

Finally, it's possible to tag save and upload the track:

## Editing, Vespucci #

Editing is generally done as after mapping on a computer, but it can be really helpful to be able to make some changes from your phone, especially once you're more
experienced, I would recommend using [Vespucci](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android), 
Vespucci is getting better and better all the time, and does a really good job editing using the touch interface. This isn't necessary a beginners tool, 
but a good tool that continues to improve that's definitly worth looking at.

When you click on the map, it allows you to choose what item you wish to edit, which is a good solution to the problem of never being able to select accurately enough with
your finger. Geometries can then we tweaked as neccessary.

Although I tend to use it to make small changes such as editing tags rather than big edits, it's a powerfull tool that only gets better.

## Data Gathering #

### Accessibilty, Wheelmap #

[Wheelmap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wheelmap.android.online) is a great example of a simple data gathering app.
The wheelchair app collects accessibilty information as well as some simple addressing information to be displayed on the [Wheelmap Site](http://wheelmap.org/en/)

### Addressing, Keypadmapper #

As we have mapped a significant proportion of the road network, there is now a big push to collect addressing data
[Keypadmapper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.enaikoon.android.keypadmapper3) is a simple app to collect addressing data as 
you move down the road simply enter the numbers as you pass them. Later the address points can be loaded into [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) for adding into
OpenStreetMap.
