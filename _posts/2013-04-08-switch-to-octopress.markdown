So almost as often as I post, I rewrite the site. This time I have switched it to [Octopress](http://octopress.org). This is the 3rd blogging engine, I've used 

{% imgcap /post-assets/2010-01-21-new-year-new-blog-probably-the-same-old-story/website_before.png Serendipity Site %}
{% imgcap /post-assets/2010-01-21-new-year-new-blog-probably-the-same-old-story/website_new.png  Wordpress Site %}
{% imgcap /post-assets/2013-04-08-switch-to-octopress/site_screenshot_octopress_310.jpg  Octopress Site %}

I don't get enough hits to justify the performance need of a static site, but it has the advantage of being one less wordpress site to maintain, and for me writting posts using 
markdown in vim is a definite win.

I have also taken the oportunity to switch to a small cluster I've setup using [ByteMark's BigV](http://bigv.io/)

Also a change, the [code for this site](https://github.com/chrisfleming/octopress) is all on github. The [commit history](https://github.com/chrisfleming/octopress/commits/master) 
provides a nice history of the work and changes I've made to the standard Octopress site. This is largely in area's of the category handling, and removing the banner. I may base some future posts on this.
