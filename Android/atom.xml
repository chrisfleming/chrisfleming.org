    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So with a <a href="http://attending.io/events/localtivate-mapping-day">mapping party</a>
coming at the weekend.  I thought that it was about time that I start this
series of posts that I’ve been planning for a while, so hopefully here is part
1 Android applications for collecting data.</p>

<h2 id="tracking-osm-tracker"> Tracking, OSM Tracker</h2>

<p>One of the key apps, is something that can track where you are, providing a
record of where you’ve been and allowing you to upload it to the OpenStreetMap
website. OSM’s heritage is built around collecting data using a GPS, and it still 
remains a powerfull way of mapping an area without requiring other sources. And 
we actually are all carrying a GPS device around with us in our pocket it is
very easy to do.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker">OSM Tracker</a>
it’s a simple app, and does it well, as well as recording a GPS trail, it also 
allows you to take pictures, and display the track on a map.</p>

<p>Use is really simple, start a new track:</p>

<p><img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/OSMTracker_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once it is running, it displays the currently GPS Position, shortcuts for taking a picture, and noting various features:</p>

<p><img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/OSMTracker_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is also possible to view the track on a map, this is really useful for checking the current area mapped, and seeing where you’ve been:</p>

<p><img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/OSMTracker_3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, it’s possible to tag save and upload the track:</p>

<p><img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/OSMTracker_4.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="editing-vespucci">Editing, Vespucci</h2>

<p>Editing is generally done as after mapping on a computer, but it can be really helpful to be able to make some changes from your phone, especially once you’re more
experienced, I would recommend using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android">Vespucci</a>, 
Vespucci is getting better and better all the time, and does a really good job editing using the touch interface. This isn’t necessary a beginners tool, 
but a good tool that continues to improve that’s definitly worth looking at.</p>

<p><img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/vespucci_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you click on the map, it allows you to choose what item you wish to edit, which is a good solution to the problem of never being able to select accurately enough with
your finger. Geometries can then we tweaked as neccessary.</p>

<p><img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/vespucci_3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Although I tend to use it to make small changes such as editing tags rather than big edits, it’s a powerfull tool that only gets better.</p>

<p><img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/vespucci_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="data-gathering">Data Gathering</h2>

<h3 id="accessibilty-wheelmap">Accessibilty, Wheelmap</h3>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wheelmap.android.online">Wheelmap</a> is a great example of a simple data gathering app.
The wheelchair app collects accessibilty information as well as some simple addressing information to be displayed on the <a href="http://wheelmap.org/en/">Wheelmap Site</a></p>

<p><img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/wheelmap_1.png" alt="" />
<img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/wheelmap_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="addressing-keypadmapper">Addressing, Keypadmapper</h3>

<p>As we have mapped a significant proportion of the road network, there is now a big push to collect addressing data
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.enaikoon.android.keypadmapper3">Keypadmapper</a> is a simple app to collect addressing data as 
you move down the road simply enter the numbers as you pass them. Later the address points can be loaded into <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM</a> for adding into
OpenStreetMap.</p>

<p><img src="/post-assets/2014-03-23-android-apps-for-mapping/keypadmapper.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So a quick summary of the apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tracking: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker">OSM Tracker</a></li>
  <li>Editing: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android">Vespucci</a></li>
  <li>Accessibilty: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wheelmap.android.online">Wheelmap</a></li>
  <li>Addressing: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.enaikoon.android.keypadmapper3">Keypadmapper</a></li>
</ul>
