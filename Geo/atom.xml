    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So for anyone not following me on twitter, I’m currently attending <a href="http://culturehackscotland.com/">Culture Hack Scotland</a>; basically the big idea is to try and bring the tech and culture communities together. This is also based around a set of <a href="http://culturehackscotland.com/data">open data</a> which including fringe data, although for 2011 at least the fringe data will have some restrictions applied to it; however it’s a great step forward.</p>

<p>There are lots of idea’s going on, some of which are quite exciting. However my plan is to work on a “Festival” Rendering of openstreetmap for Edinburgh, I’m really just at the point where I can start to render maps and have a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Edinburgh_Festivals">proposed tagging scheme</a> for doing this within OSM.</p>

<p>Still lots of work to do but at the moment I have started to put Fringe Venues on the map:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve just noticed that Google have finally got round to updating the Google Earth imagery for Edinburgh. It’s about time to as the
<a href="http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=55.946725~-3.193932&amp;style=a&amp;lvl=14&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000">Microsoft</a> 
and <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=s&amp;trf=0&amp;lon=-3.192129&amp;lat=55.945223&amp;mag=3">Yahoo</a> aerial imagery have covered Edinburgh for some time now.</p>

<p>It looks to me like the images of Edinburgh were captured  in August last year, the level of detail is very impressive. 
A few nice things to point out here are, sitting on the Meadows we can see the big top circus tent and fairground used over the festival.

<p>Also of interest is the aerial view of of the <a href="http://www.qmile.com/">Quartermile</a> development. We can see how much of the area has been 
demolished and how much the area still has to be developed.</p>

<p>The winding areas of the castle is also well worth a look. The bandstands put up for the <a href="http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/">Edinburgh  Tattoo</a>
is in evidence on the esplanade.</p>
